# NexentaEdge DevOps Edition
NexentaEdge DevOps Edition is a purpose built and packaged solution for providing a scale-out infrastructure for containerized applications, providing all necessary storage, networking and compute services from a single solution.

NexentaEdge DevOps Edition nodes are deployed as containers on physical or virtual hosts, pooling all their storage capacity and presenting it as native block devices, NFS shares, or S3 objects to containerized applications running on the same servers.  All storage services are managed through standard Docker tools, for greater agility and scalability.
